## Why does this exist?
MPV supports drag-and-drop for subtitles but requires command-line flags like ```--audio-file=track.mp3``` for external audio tracks.
This is fine for a single file, but when you have multiple videos each with their own audio tracks, it becomes tedious.
This tool automates the process — you select your video files, audio files, hit play, and it handles the integration automatically.

## Features

- 🎵 **Easy Audio Management**: Quickly attach external audio tracks to your video playback
- ⚡ **MPV Integration**: Seamlessly works with your existing MPV installation
- 📁 **File Organization**: Save and load audio track configurations for repeated use

## Usage
1. Add MPV to PATH or set a full path in config (%APPDATA%\mpv-audio) after the first launch of software
2. Run & Enjoy!

## Installation
### Windows
1. Download the latest release from [Releases Page](https://github.com/regularentropy/mpv_audio)
2. Ensure MPV is installed and is in your system PATH
3. Unzip & run the executable.
